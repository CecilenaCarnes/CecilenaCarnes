This project is an about me, my business ventures thus far, interests and possible future endevors.  I tend to squeeze the most out of a minute that I can and joining CodeKentucky was no exception.  I am sure by the final push for submission this will not meet my design standards but I do hope that it meets the requirements to move into the next class.





Media Queries - Site adjusts for 3 seperate size screens.  There are 3 files that do a portion of this Small.css, Medium.css and Large.css.  I have built in other media query properties into the grid.css to alter the layout at each size and the index.html file to alter the images shown at each size.
    Small screen is a single column and image. Iphone 6/7/8 Plus
    Medium screen is two columns and a new image. IPAD
    Large screen is two columns with a new image and reversal of image/content. Desktop


CSS
    Name Color changes based on screen size. 
    Navigation menu expands and collapses on click of the hamburger button.
    Grid content changes from single column to double column based on screen size.  Max screen size results in columns being reversed.





JavaScript
    sitenav.js - Navigation|Hamburger Button expands and collapses the navigation on all screen sizes. Uses toogle options onclick and open.
    picturefill.js - Used to make the photos change and be responsive for different screen sizes.
    rentalcalculation.html contains javascript to calculate a value and display it to the user.
